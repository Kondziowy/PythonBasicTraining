Thanks for enrolling to Basic Python training.

This training assumes you have basic understanding of programming concepts
(loops, variables, conditions).

After this training you should:
- Understand most Python code
- Write simple apps
- Apply good programming practices
- Know commonly used libraries

During this training we will not:
- Learn a particular Python framework (Django, PyGame, SqlAlchemy) in depth
- Discuss Python internals and library bindings
- Discuss advanced Python concepts - decorators, generators

This training is going to focus on Python 3. Even if your codebase is 
in Python 2, you shouldn't find it hard to adjust.

This training is going to be part lecture and part workshop. You will be writing
bits of code.
You can work on your laptop or on a remote server/VM with Internet access.
To ensure you have a working environment needed for the training, please do the following:

1) Install Python 3.6 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Install python-pip (preinstalled on Windows, separate package on Linuxes)
3) Add your Python installation directory to PATH
5) Test if your configuration works:
- open console / cmd.exe
- run pip install requests
- type python
- type import requests
- type requests.get("http://www.wp.pl")
- You should see a "Response <200> message"

E-mail me if you have any problems.
